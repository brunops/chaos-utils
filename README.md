#chaos-utils

These are utility functions from [Playing with chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Chaos-Programming-Attractors-JavaScript-ebook/dp/B00FA9CX2Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473648523&sr=8-1&keywords=playing+with+chaos) book.

These seem to be functions used throughout and because I like to use commonjs and building tools (like webpack), why not create a module?

hope it's useful :)
